# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Upon airing the newest Fifty Shades Freed movie on this Valentine’s day, Universal Studios has posted multiple short trailer on social media and received a great interaction from the audience. Given more than 60 thousands re-tweets on twitter, the production team now wants to know whether the audience’s reaction was positive, negative or neutral. This tweet labeling task is called sentiment analysis. It is well employed to study the customers feedback and respond accordingly, or to study public opinion regarding current events (MemeTracker) or that a politician (e.g. Donald Trump). 
The challenge Sentiment analysis could be done quickly by a human skimming through a short paragraph of a specific topic and deciding complex emotions that the text conveys such as satisfaction, frustration, anger, etc. However, for an algorithm that cannot understand the real meaning that words convey, automatic sentiment analysis becomes a challenging task. Instead of looking at all the words, a sentiment analysis algorithm recognizes and bases on the keywords in the text to decide the overall emotional status of the input.

In this project, we aim to implement a twitter sentiment analysis application using pySpark.
This application analyzes the sentiment of a tweet that user inputted and the task is broken down to the following sub-tasks. Given the scope of this project, we kept the implementation of the application on the local machine's filesystem once and another time while utilizing Hadoop HDFS.

- Data collecting
- Data pre-processing
- Algorithms implementation
- Performance evaluation
